# Support Resources

Please do not use the issue tracker for questions about your own code. The
tracker is for issues related to the project itself.

Search with Google using the name of the project and some keywords, an exception
message, etc. It can be helpful to add `site:stackoverflow.com` to search Stack
Overflow for answers.

Reduce your question to a [minimal reproducible example][]. This may help you
identify the issue yourself, and will make it much easier for others to help
you.

The `#questions` channel on our [Discord chat][] can be used to chat
with and get help from other users in the community.

Many projects have GitHub's Discussions feature enabled. If you see the
Discussions tab at the top of a project's repository, you can ask your question
in the Q&A category. Members of the community can post answers, or ask you for
more information. You can accept the answer that helped you solve the problem.

We encourage community members to join our Discord chat and GitHub Discussions
to help others with their questions. Please help us grow the community and help
others learn.
